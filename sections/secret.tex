\section{Secret task}

We managed to run the three secret tasks successfully on DaCe. The instructions are listed as follows:
\circled{1} Modify the input arguments to the datatype  \texttt{dace.float64[N, M]}. The array dimension is declared inside the brackets \texttt{[]}. For a two-dimension array, \texttt{[N, M]} will be used.
\circled{2} Identify the data dependency inside the for loops. For instance, two nested loops in the \texttt{wdist} benchmark can be parallized by employing \texttt{dace.map[0:M,0:N]}.
\circled{3} Some NumPy functions cannot be processed by DaCe. For instance, \texttt{np.average()} is not supported, which is shown in the \texttt{lstsqr} benchmark. Therefore, we implement another function which is compatible with DaCe and computes the average value of the given array.
