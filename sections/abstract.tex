\begin{abstract}
As part of the Student Cluster Competition at the SC22 conference, this work aims to reproduce the performance evaluations of the Data Centric (DaCe) Python framework by leveraging Intel MKL and NVIDIA CUDA interface. The evaluations are conducted on a single CPU-based node, NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and a eight-node cloud supercomputer. Our experimental results successfully reproduce the performance evaluations on our cluster. Additionally, we provide insightful analysis and propose effective methods for achieving higher performance when utilizing DaCe as an acceleration library.
