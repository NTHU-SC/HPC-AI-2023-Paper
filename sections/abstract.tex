The main focus of this outcome lies in our participation in the sixth HPCAI competition. As the championship team, we are going to attend at the SCA conference. In light of this, we have decided to share and conclude the results of our participation in this competition for our paper. The content include machine configurations, preparation for the tasks, optimization techniques employed, as well as our approach to problem analysis. Additionally, we elaborate on how we presented our final results and conclusions.
