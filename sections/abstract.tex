APAC HPC-AI Competition is one of the major international student competitions for developing young talents with interdisciplinary skills in the field of High Performance Computing~(HPC) and AI~(Artificial Intelligence). The goal of the competition is to optimize the performance of HPC and AI applications, such as the Climate Prediction Model MPAS and the Large Language Model Bloom for this year's competition.  This paper summarizes the experience and performance optimization techniques we learned from the competition. As the champion of the competition in 2023, we hope our work can inspire more students to participate the competition, and shed the light on how to prepare the competition and what skills are required for winning the competition. 


%The main focus of this outcome lies in our participation in the sixth HPCAI competition. As the championship team, we are going to attend at the SCA conference. In light of this, we have decided to share and conclude the results of our participation in this competition for our paper. The content include machine configurations, preparation for the tasks, optimization techniques employed, as well as our approach to problem analysis. Additionally, we elaborate on how we presented our final results and conclusions.
